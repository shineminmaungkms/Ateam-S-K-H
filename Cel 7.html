<blockquote style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 280px; font-family: courier;">Country music originated in the countryside of the <b>United States back in the 1920s</b>. It combines the cowboy music of the west with the folk music of the southeast. The genre is usually played on classical instruments, particularly those with strings. Country songs are characterized by simple lyrics and melancholy ballads, with themes that revolve around hard life, loneliness, and love.</blockquote>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 280px; font-family: courier;">The Bones by Maren Morris, Die From A Broken Heart by Maddie & Tae, I Hope You’re Happy Now by Carly Pearce & Lee Brice, and The Legend of John Henry’s Hammer by Johnny Cash are a few of the most memorable songs from this genre.</blockquote>
