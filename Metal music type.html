The term “metal” is believed to have come from the hippie movement, when “heavy” meant deep or serious.Metal music is a subgenre of rock music with roots that date back to the 1960s. Similar to rock, metal music is characterized by heavy sounds and the domination of electric and bass guitars.However, metal music has a faster tempo than classic rock and is generally more aggressive, with deeper sounds and higher distortions. Heavy metal songs also use dark themes that revolve around war, death, fear, and sadness. Some noteworthy metal songs include Master of Puppets by Metallica, Iron Man by Black Sabbath, Angel of Death by Slayer, and The Trooper by Iron Maiden.</blockquote>

    <td><p style="text-align: center; color: silver; font-family: courier; text-align: left;">The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the "rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency".[21] In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures—generally made up of 8th or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.</p></td>
