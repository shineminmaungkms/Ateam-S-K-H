    <td><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 179px;">The term “<b>EDM</b>” is <b>incredibly expansive</b>. It may refer to mainstream EDM music or other electronic sub-genres like house, techno, and trance. EDM or Electronic Dance Music is mostly played in clubs. Its repetitive and uplifting beat makes it easy to dance to.</p>

    	<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 179px;">This type of song is characterized by a four-beat measure kick or bass drum, followed by a bass drop or “the downbeat”. Some notable pieces of EDM music include Lean On by Major Lazer & DJ Snake, Where Are Ü Now by Jack Ü. & Justin Bieber, Wake Me Up by Avicii, and Don’t You Worry Child by Swedish House Mafia & John Martin.</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 179px;">This is one of the reasons why EDM, the latest term being used to describe dance music, is so problematic. The letters stand for Electronic Dance Music, a blanket term if ever there was one, meant to cover the myriad of sounds and styles of music made by electronic instruments for people to dance to.</p></td>
