It’s basically a blend of soul music with ska. The genre has been linked to a religious movement that calls for the worship of Haile Selassie, the former Emperor of Ethiopia.</p></blockquote>

   	<blockquote style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 280px; font-family: courier;"><p style="text-align: center;"> The genre has pretty much gone extinct in the past few years when it comes to the number of artists that sing it. But it still has a solid fanbase in Jamaica, its homeland. Reggae also inspires many of the top-rated songs from other genres. <u>Some popular reggae songs include Pressure Drop by Toots And The Maytals, I Can See Clearly Now by Johnny Nash, and Switch Up by Proteje and Koffee.</u></p></blockquote></td>

   <td colspan="2"><blockquote style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 280px; font-family: courier;"><b>Reggae (/ˈrɛɡeɪ/)</b> is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, <u>"Do the Reggay" was the first popular song to use the word "reggae"</u>, effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady.</blockquote></td>
