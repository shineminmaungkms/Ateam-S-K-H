    <td width="70%"><b><p style="text-align: center; font-family: verdana;">Classical music is one of the oldest types of music in existence, dating back to as early as the 5th century.</p></b>

    	<p style="text-align: center; font-family: verdana;">Simple diatonic harmony, contrasting moods, and balanced melodies are a few of the features of classical music. This genre is also characterized by homophonic texture and a focus on elegance.</p>

    	<p style="text-align: center; font-family: verdana;">Some of the most inspiring works of classical music include Mozart’s Eine kleine Nachtmusik, Puccini’s O mio babbino caro, Felix Mendelssohn’s Symphony No. 4, and Beethoven’s Für Elise.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: verdana;">Classical music generally refers to the <b>formal musical tradition of the Western world</b>, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions.</p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p style="text-align: center; font-family: verdana; text-align: left; text-align: justify; text-indent: 45px;">It is sometimes distinguished as Western classical music, as the term "classical music" may also refer to non-Western traditions which exhibit similar formal qualities. In addition to formality, classical music is often characterized by complexity in its musical form and harmonic organization, particularly with the use of polyphony. Since at least the 9th-century it has been primarily a written tradition, spawning a sophisticated notational system, as well as accompanying literature in analytical, critical, historiographical, musicological and philosophical practices.</p></td>
